There is a vast literature in signal processing about designing filters to transform one signal into another. In speech processing, our signals often includes some sort of noise that we'd like to get rid of.  However, we can also use filters to shape a simple input, like an impulse train, into something much more complicated, like a speech waveform. \n",

So, if we know what type of frequency response $h$ has, we can treat this as apply a sort of mask to the DFT of $x$.  This property is known as the **convolution theorem**. \n",
