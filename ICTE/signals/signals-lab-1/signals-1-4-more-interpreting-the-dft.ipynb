    "\n",
    "The [previous notebook](./signals-1-3-discrete-fourier-transform-in-detail.ipynb) went through the mechanics of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).  To summarize, the DFT input and output are broadly: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:**  $N$ amplitude samples over time \n",
    "    * $x[n]$, for $n=0..N-1$ (i.e. a time series of $N$ samples)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Output:** the dot product (i.e., the similiarity) between the input and $N$ sinusoids with different frequencies\n",
    "    * DFT[k] $= Me^{-j\\phi}$, i.e. a complex number (in polar form) with **magnitude** $M$ and **phase** angle $\\phi$\n",
    "    * The $N$ DFT outputs represent $N$ equally space frequencies between 0 and the sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "The outputs are calculated using the following formula for $k=0,...N-1$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "DFT[k] &= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi nk}{N}} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\big[\\cos\\big(\\frac{2\\pi nk}{N} \\big) - j \\sin\\big(\\frac{2\\pi nk}{N} \\big) \\big]\n",

Each of these DFT[k] 'clocks' corresponds to a sinusoid of a specific frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each DFT[k] output essentially tells us whether the input signal has a sinusoidal component that matches the $k$th DFT complex sinusoid frequency. So, we talk about the DFT outputs as providing the **frequency response** of the input signal. \n",

The **phase angle** of DFT[k] tells use whether we need to shift that wave along the time axis. "

    "## The DFT Frequency Response:  Which Frequencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the first notebook on interpreting the DFT](./signals-1-1-interpreting-the-discrete-fourier-transform.ipynb) we saw that for input of length $N$, the DFT **output analysis frequencies** are $N$ evenly space points between 0 Hz and the sampling rate. So, how can we see this from the DFT equation?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can first note that DFT[0] (corresponding to a 0 Hz, i.e., a complex sinusoid but stuck at one point) is the average of the input sequence. This tells us  the amplitude of the waveform (i.e. whether it's centered above or below 0 in amplitude).  This is often referred to as the DC component ('Direct Current') in electrical engineering texts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can work out all the other output frequencies by noticing that DFT[1] represents a complex sinusoid that takes N equal steps to make one complete one full circle (clockwise starting from (1,0)).  So, $e^{-j 2\\pi n/N}$ in the equation represents the $n$th step around the circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the **sampling rate** as $f_s$ (samples/second).  We can then figure out the frequency of represented by DFT[1] by figuring out the time it takes to make one cycle (i.e., the period), which is the time it takes to make $N$ steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The time between each sample (i.e., the **sampling time**) is $t_s = 1/f_s$  (seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* So, $N$ samples takes $t_s \\times N$  (seconds x samples = seconds)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* And it will take the $k=1$ complex sinusoid $T = t_s \\times N$  (seconds) to make 1 complete cycle\n",
    "    * This is the **period** or **wavelength** of the complex sinusoid\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* Thus, the **frequency** of the $k=1$ complex sinusoid is $f_{min} = 1/T = 1/(t_s N) $ (cycles/second) \n",
    "    * i.e., $f_{min} = f_s/N$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the minimum frequency that we can analyse in an application of the DFT $f_{min}$ depends on the input size $N$ and the sampling rate $f_s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From there we can see that DFT[k] represents a complex sinusoid that completes the circle $k$ times faster than the one corresponding to DFT[1]. That is, \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since  $k$ = 0,...,$N-1$, this is the same as saying we take taking N evenly space points between 0 Hz and the sampling rate, $f_s$, which is the shortcut we took in [the first notebook on the DFT](./signals-1-1-interpreting-the-discrete-fourier-transform.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about this in terms of sampling rates and aliasing  explains why you get the mirroring effect in the DFT outputs: Once you get to half the sampling rate, your samples are too far apart (in time) to capture the actual frequency of the sinusoid, as we can't capture 2 points per cycle. Sinusoids of those higher frequencies become indistinguishable from their lower (mirror) counterpart.  So in analyzing what frequency components are in an input signal we only consider the first $N/2$ DFT outputs (corresponding to 0 to $f_s/2$ Hz, i.e. the Nyquist Frequency)  \n",

However, if the input frequency falls between output frequencies, then you'll see **spectral leakage**.
