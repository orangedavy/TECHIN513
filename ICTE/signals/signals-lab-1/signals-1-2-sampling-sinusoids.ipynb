    "\n",
    "At this point, we should say that you can get a conceptual understanding of digital signal processing concepts without going through _all_ the math. We certainly won't be examining your knowledge of complex numbers or geometry in this class.  Of course, if you want to go further in understanding digital signal processing then you will have to learn a bit more about complex numbers, algebra, calculus and geometry than we'll touch upon here.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, right now the main point that we'd like you to take away from this notebook is that we can conveniently represent periodic functions, like sine waves, in terms of **complex sinusoids**: basically what shown on the left hand side of the following gif:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Complex sinusoid to sine wave gif](../fig/phasor.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the complex sinusoid (left) as an analogue clockface with one moving hand. On the right hand side is one period of a 'pure tone' (real) sinusoid, sin(t).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can think of every movement of the 'clockhand' (a complex number which we can represent as a **2D vector**) as a step in time on the sinusoid graph: at every time step the 'clockhand' vector rotates by some angle. If you follow the blue dots on both graphs, you should be able to see that the amplitude of the sinusoid matches the height of the vector at each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a different way of viewing the periodicity of $\\sin(t)$.  The sinusoid starts to repeat itself when the vector has done one full circle. So, rather than drawing out an infinite time vs amplitude graph, we can capture the behaviour of this periodic function in terms rotations with respect to this finite circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the connection with complex numbers?  Well, that blue dot on  actually represents a complex number, and the dimensions of that graph are actually the **real** (horizontal) and **imaginary** (vertical) parts of that complex number. That is, a complex number of the form $a + jb$, where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part.  Quite conveniently, we can also express complex numbers in terms of a **magnitude** or radius $r$ (length of the clockhand) and a **phase angle** $\\theta$ (angle of rotation from the point (1,0)) and an exponential.  So, we can write each point that the rotation hits in the form $re^{j\\theta}$.  This will be familiar if you've had a look at the DFT formulae. \n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship with complex numbers basically allows us to describe complicated periodic waveforms in terms of combinations of 'pure tone' sinusoids.  It turns out that maths for this works very elegantly using the complex number based representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic things you need to know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **sinusoid** (time vs amplitude, i.e. in the **time domain**) can be described in terms of a vector rotating around a circle\n",
    "* That rotating vector (i.e., 'clockhand') is described by a complex number $re^{j\\theta}$\n",
    "* $re^{j\\theta}$ is a point on a circle centered at (0,0) with radius  $r$, $\\theta$ degrees rotated from $(r,0)$ on the 2D plane. \n",
    "    * the **magnitude** $r$ tells us what the peak amplitude of the corresponding sine wave is\n",
    "    * the **phase angle** $\\theta$ tells us how far around the circle the rotation has gone:\n",
    "      * zero degrees (0 radians) corresponds to the point (r,0), while 90 degrees ($\\pi/2$ radians) corresponds to the point (0,r)\n",
    "* The vertical projection of the vector (onto the y-axis) corresponds to the amplitude of a **sine wave** $\\sin(\\theta)$ \n",
    "* The horizontal projection of the vector (onto the x-axis) corresponds to the amplitude of a **cosine wave** $\\cos(\\theta)$ \n",
    "* The **period** of these sine and cosine waves is the same as the time it takes to make one full circle of the complex sinusoid (in seconds). As such the **frequency** of the sine and cosine waves is the same as the frequency with which the complex sinusoid makes a full cycle (in cycles/second = Hertz). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you take the maths on faith, you can see all of this just from the gif above. You'll probably notice in most phonetics text books, if they show this at all, they will just show the rotating vector without any of the details. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about how this works, you can find a quick tour of these concepts in the (extension) notebook on [Sinusoids and Complex Numbers](./sp-m1-2-digital-signals-complex-numbers).  But it's fine if you don't get all the details right now.  In fact, if you get the intuition behind from the complex sinusoid/sine wave relationship above, it's fine to move on now to the rest of the content in this notebook. "

    "## Maths Perspective: The DFT equation as a sum of complex sinusoids\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you look at the mathematical form of the DFT, you can start to recognize this as representing a sequence of complex sinusoids of different frequencies, which have a real (cosine) and imaginary (sine) component. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DFT is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For input: $x[n]$, for $n=0..N-1$ (i.e. a time series of $N$ samples)\n",
    "* We calculate an output of N complex numbers $\\mapsto$ magnitude and phases of specific complex sinusoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the $k$th output, DFT[k], is calculated using the following equation: \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "DFT[k] &= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi n}{N} k} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is equivalent to the following (using Euler's rule):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "DFT[k] &= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\big[\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N} k) - j \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N} k) \\big] \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically says that each DFT output is the result of multiplying the $n$th input value $x[n]$ with the $n$th sample of a complex sinusoid (hence sine and cosine waves) of a specific frequency, and summing the result (hence the complex number output). The frequency of DFT[k] is $k$ times the frequency of DFT[1], where the frequency of DFT[1] depends on the input size $N$ and the sampling rate (as discussed the [this notebook](./signals-1-1-interpreting-the-discrete-fourier-transform.ipynb)). The sampling rate determines the time each rotation step takes, hence how much time it takes to make a full cycle, hence what frequencies we can actually compare the input against.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The pointwise multiplication and summation is also known as a dot product (aka inner product).  The dot product between two vectors tells us how similar those two vectors are. So in a very rough sense, the DFT 'figures out' which frequency components are present in the input, by looking at how similar the input is to each of the N complex sinusoids represented in the DFT output. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two more notebooks on the DFT for this module, but both are extension material (not essential).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [This notebook](./signals-1-3-discrete-fourier-transform-in-detail.ipynb) goes into more maths details but is purely extension material\n",
    "* [This notebook](./signals-1-4-more-interpreting-the-dft.ipynb) looks at a few more issues in interpreting the DFT (also extension material)\n",
