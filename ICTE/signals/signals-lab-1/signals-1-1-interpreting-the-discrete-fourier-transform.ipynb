    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the module on acoustic phonetics, we looked at how we can map the frequency components of a complex sound wave to changes in articulation.  We can 'see' speech through spectrograms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain spectrograms using the **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**.  This applies the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** to short windows of the speech signal where each window selects a specific segment of time in the waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example from praat of the spectrograms generated from me saying a bunch of vowels. The default window size is 5 milliseconds (ms).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../fig/aiueo.png\" alt=\"spectrogram of vowels /aiueo/\" widtd=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look also look at spectral slices over in praat by selecting a portion of the vowel.   The first of the two spectral slices below was generated from around 10ms while the second was generated over around 40 ms. You can see that that the spectral slice over the smaller selection is much less detailed. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, it seems the shape, and particularly the smoothness, of the spectrum changes depending on how much speech you select. The relationship between the input size and the sampling rate of your recording is something you have to know if you want to be able to interpret the output of the DFT (and hence the spectrogram). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll take a fairly high level look at the DFT, emphasizing some of the more practical aspects of interpreting the output.  We should note though that the Fourier Transform is essentially a mathematical tool.  Standard textbooks, like Jurafsky and Martin, will present the DFT as a set of equations.  We don't expect you to understand all the maths behind this for this course. The main goal is to give you enough details about the DFT for you to be able to understand the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What does the DFT tell you about the the input signal? \n",
    "* What is the output of the DFT? How do you interpret it? How does it relate to what you see in a Spectrogram? \n",

    "\n",
    "You've seen in the course videos (e.g. [Fourier Analysis](https://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/module-3-digital-speech-signals/)) that we can break down complicated waveforms into a combination of simpler components, specifically **sinusoids** of different frequencies. This is basically what the Discrete Fourier Transform _does_.  \n",

    "In this picture, you should see a somewhat complicated waveform on the left and the 3 sinusoidal (i.e., [pure tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone)) components on the right (8 Hz, 20 Hz, 36 Hz).  We can decompose the waveform on the left into the three on the right. Each of these components has a different **peak amplitude**.  You might also notice that the first and the third components start with value 1 at time zero: they're actually cosine waves rather than sine waves. When we add (or **superimpose**) these 3 waves together over the same time interval, we get back the waveform on the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier Transform is the tool we use to break down complicated periodic waveforms into sinusoidal components representing specific frequencies. For speech sounds, the relative magnitudes of these frequency components affects what phones/words/sentences we hear. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment, we can think of the Fourier Transform as a tool that takes a sequence of measurements in time as input and outputs a sequence of values that tell you what pure tones you would need to recreate the orignal waveform. This tool is made of maths, so if you don't know what it's actually doing you might get a bit of a shock if you just apply some 'off-the-shelf' version unless you know how to interpret the output!  \n",

    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, we'll first have to generate some input. So, here's some code to generate simple sine wave (220 Hz).  You'll notice that since we're in the digital world, we have to approximate the sine wave with a sequence of points (amplitude measurements) in time. This means we have specify a **sampling rate**, which tells the computer how often we took those amplitude measurements (samples/second).  The sampling rate is a very important factor in interpreting the DFT output (we'll  come back to this!).  \n",

    "Now, let's generate 220Hz sine wave with a 8000 Hz sampling rate for 0.2 seconds and plot it.\n",

    "\n",
    "* When the input to the DFT is a sequence of $N$ real numbers, the DFT outputs are a sequence of $N$ complex numbers. \n",
    "    * e.g., Since our input was a sequence of 1600 points sampled from a 220 Hz sine wave, our output was 1600 complex numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The lowest frequency that the DFT output can capture is `sampling_rate/N` Hz and the other analysis frequences are all integer multiples of this.  The frequency associated with DFT[k] is $kf_s/N$ for $k=0,...,N-1$, where $f_s$ is the sampling rate. \n",
    "    * e.g. with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz and an input of 1600 points, the lowest frequency `X[1]` is 8000/1600 = 5 Hz\n",
    "    * For the example above, this is why the 44th output represents 220Hz (44x5 Hz = 220 Hz)\n",
    "    * The very first DFT output, `X[0]` maps to 0Hz.  This actually tells us the bias of the signal with respect to the amplitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The less input samples $N$ you have, the fewer frequencies you can analyze using the DFT.  \n",
    "    * You'll see this in praat when you compare a spectral slice taken over varying amounts of the waveform. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the input waveform includes a sinusoidal ('pure tone') component of frequency $kf_s/N$, we will observe a non-zero magnitude for DFT[k]. \n",
    "    * This why we see a spike at the 44th output (220 Hz) in the spectrum \n",
    "    * We calculate the magnitude by taking the absolute value of the DFT output,  this essentially tells us how far away the output $a+bj$ (i.e, the coordinate $(a,b)$) is from $0+0j$ (i.e, the coordinate $(0,0)$) and is proportional to the peak amplitude of that frequency component. \n",
    "    * This decomposition works perfectly in theory, but in practice we don't always fully meet the assumptions get a perfect decomposition in to a line spectrum. Due to our need to sample and do short-time analysis, a non-zero magnitude doesn't always mean that the input includes that frequency component. One case where this happens is when the input frequency falls between DFT output frequencies: see the exercise below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The full output of the DFT is mirrored around the _Nyquist Frequency_, i.e., half the sampling rate.\n",

    "    * This arises from the fact that we are in the digital world, working with a finite number of discrete samples (see [the notebook on digital signals and aliasing](./signals-1-2-sampling-sinusoids.ipynb))\n",

    "You may be asking yourself: How could I possibly figure this out for myself? The answer is that you can't really do this based only on an intuitive understanding of the Fourier Transform. Without understanding the how the DFT really works you, just have to take these as given. \n",

    "As mentioned previously, the DFT is a foundational element of signal processing (and a lot of other things).  As such, there are a lot of implementations already out there for you to use, rather than coding it up from scratch yourself.  However, hopefully the examples above and exercises below show that you do need to know what it actually does to interpret the results, even if you're not implementing the DFT yourself. \n",
